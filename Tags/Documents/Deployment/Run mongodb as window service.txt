Run mongoDB as a window service

Make sure that you added you /bin directory to you system variable PATH

First I executed this command:

D:\mongodb\bin>mongod --remove
First I executed this command after opening command prompt as administrator:

D:\mongodb\bin>mongod --dbpath=D:\mongodb --logpath=D:\mongodb\log.txt --install
After that right there in the command prompt execute:

net start MongoDB

And look for MongoDB service and click start.
